## 🕹️ About the Project
**8 Hackers** is a Python GUI puzzle game based on the famous **8 Queens** problem.  
Place 8 hackers on a grid in such a way that none of them can "hack" (attack) each other — no two hackers can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

Built with a clean graphical interface using **Tkinter** and **Pillow (PIL)** for hacker images.

---

## 🎮 How to Play
- Click on the board to place a hacker.
- Avoid placing hackers in the same row, column, or diagonal.
- Successfully place all 8 hackers to win the game!
- Use the reset option to start over if needed.
